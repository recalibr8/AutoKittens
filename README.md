# AutoKittens
A script that helps automate several tasks in the incremental clicker game, Kittens. The code was originally written by Michael Madsen (birdiesoft.dk).

To use, create a bookmarklet to the following URL:

<code>javascript:(function(){var d=document,s=d.createElement('script');s.src='https://rawgit.com/recalibr8/AutoKittens/master/autokittens.js';d.body.appendChild(s);})();</code>

Then simply launch the game and click the bookmarklet button. You should see a new menu option for AutoKittens, where you can configure all of the options.

<b>New in version 1.1:</b>
- Kerosene can be crafted automatically when oil reaches maximum storage limit.
- Fixed: Astronomical events are automatically observed
- Fixed: Trading happens automatically when gold limit is reached
- Display optimized for iPad
